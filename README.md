# TCGPlaybook
A PHP platform for creating and managing Trading Card Game databases, specifically focusing on deck building and card strategies.

**This is the FIRST thing I have ever built in PHP. I had roughly ZERO PHP knowledge when I started this, and it was built painstakingly over a 36 hour period pulling a double all-nighter.**

I hilariously managed to build a deck database + editor, a user database + contributor privilege, and a couple of other things that I found fancy when first learning PHP.

**Do not let the commit date fool you. This was created in late 2012. It comes with *NO documentation, NO clear direction within the code itself, and NO real structure*. This is an example of how NOT to write code.**

** It is here for archival purposes.**
